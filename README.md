# SteemCommentsSystem - Add Steem Comments To Any Website/Blog

Steem comments is a plugin that allows you to add steem comment threads to any website with the ability to comment and upvote. Include the CSS, JS and dependencies and with one line of HTML you can include any steem comments thread.

Steemcomemnts uses steem-js to load in comment thread and Steemconnects hot linking feature to allow uses to authenticate without needing to trust the website operator where the comments are viewed. 

Comments/Votes act as expect with the addition of needed to supply a username as the viewer is not logged in, when finally clicking post or vote a popup appears for Steemconnect authentication.

```

Add any html element with the class ```.sc-section``` and a ```data-steemlink``` with a full url to your steem post.
```
